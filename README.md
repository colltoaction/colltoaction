Hello from Buenos Aires, Argentina! ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·

I'm MartÃ­n Coll, a computer scientist and engineer building a new generation of programming tools and computer systems.

## Iâ€™m currently working on

### HIF: Hypergraph Interchange Format
HIF is a standard for representing higher-order network data, designed to enable seamless data exchange between higher-order network analysis
software packages. A growing number of libraries support this standard including: [HypergraphX](https://github.com/HGX-Team/hypergraphx), [HyperNetX](https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX), [XGI](https://github.com/xgi-org/xgi) and [HypergraphAnalysisToolbox](https://github.com/Jpickard1/Hypergraph-Analysis-Toolbox).

I will present HIF at NetSci2025 in the Software and Data for Supporting Network Science satellite.

### MLIR Inet dialect
The MLIR Inet dialect is an addition to the MLIR core allowing one to work with Interaction Nets.

### Widip: Wiring Diagram Processing
Widip is a computing system that uses YAML as an intermediate representation of Hypergraphs. `nx_yaml` supports the round-trip of the standard YAML textual form through NetworkX as the implementation of the internal graph representation.

### FPGAs and hardware development
I have an academic interest in Reversible Computing with applications to Quantum systems. I'm also working with an open Argentinian board to help local innovation.

### Academic writing
I publish plain text sources for academic and related writings. These can be edited to produce new binary artifacts such as PDFs.

## Recent work
### Spanish talks
Intento compartir mis conocimientos en espaÃ±ol y mantengo esta playlist actualizada:

### Future work
I want to present Widip to a large audience such as in a conference. I'm preparing a paper and also working towards a robust implementation. I'm building a community that can push this project to the next level.
