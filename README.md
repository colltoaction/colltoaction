## Future work
Using the diagrammatic development environment I want to explore some of these topics:
* compilers
  * abstract syntax trees
  * instruction set architectures
  * MLIR and intermediate representations
  * bytecode formats
* programming
  * Kubernetes
  * composing LLMs, AI in general
  * UNIX
  * Reactive programming
  * Ethereum
  * custom hardware
  * formalized programs
* self improvement
  * binary bootstrapping using Julia
  * git(hub) decentralized program distribution
  * extend library
