H! I'm Coll and I'm a full-time researcher and software engineer.

I quit the industry after 10 years to dedicate full-time to contributing. This means I pick my own research topics and then develop the things I think programmers are missing.

I'm receiving donations to ensure sustainability of this project for the years to come. I want to be an independent open contributor and your help will have a big impact in my economy.

I'm working towards QPL 2024! This is a really exciting and ambitious challenge but I hope I can give a tool session. I'm a Computer Scientist from UBA, I'm a local, and I have a unique opportunity to participate :)
