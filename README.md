I invite you to join me on a personal journey.

I'm a full-time researcher and developer and I contribute everything I do. This is an ethics stance.

I pick research topics based on my interests and this is the only way my brain can work.

I believe this work is important and prioritize it over income.

I'm very human and by using GitHub sponsors you can put some money in my pocket with your credit card. This helps me focus and forget how much companies are paying.

Thank you 🙏🏼
