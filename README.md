Hello from Buenos Aires, Argentina! üá¶üá∑

I'm Mart√≠n Coll, a computer scientist and engineer building a new generation of programming tools and computer systems.

I believe that in this era of hardware-software co-design, software development has the largest upside considering the lag behind computer science and math. It is also necessary to develop more theory, as we keep discovering useful models.

## I‚Äôm currently working on

### HIF: Hypergraph Interchange Format
I'm a co-author in the HIF paper and presented it at NetSci2025.

> To enable seamless data exchange between higher-order network analysis software packages, we introduce the Hypergraph Interchange Format (HIF), a standardized format for storing higher-order network data. HIF supports multiple types of higher-order networks, including undirected hypergraphs, directed hypergraphs, and simplicial complexes, while actively exploring extensions to represent multiplex hypergraphs, temporal hypergraphs, and ordered hypergraphs. This initiative is a collaborative effort involving authors, maintainers, and contributors from prominent hypergraph software packages. This project introduces a JSON schema with corresponding documentation and unit tests, example HIF-compliant datasets, and tutorials demonstrating the use of HIF with several popular higher-order network analysis software packages.

### MLIR Inet dialect
The MLIR Inet dialect is an addition to the core of the MLIR compiler formalizing Interaction Nets.

### Widip: Wiring Diagram Processing
Widip is a computing system that uses YAML as an intermediate representation of Hypergraphs. `nx_yaml` supports the round-trip of the standard YAML textual form through NetworkX as the implementation of the internal graph representation.

### Academic writing
I publish plain text sources for academic and related writings. These can be edited to produce new binary artifacts such as PDFs.
