Hi, I'm Coll! I'm a full-time researcher and software engineer building a diagrammatic software stack.

After 10 years in the industry and much work on the side I decided to concentrate in this project. I produce lots of Creative Commons Zero that you might want to support!

## YAML Diagrams
I'm building a diagrammatical development environment with UNIX and YAML.

## QPL 2024
I presented a poster to the Quantum Physics and Logic 2024 conference. It is an academic presentation of YAML Diagrams and can be found here:

## Future work
Using the diagrammatic development environment I want to explore some of these topics:
* compilers
  * abstract syntax trees
  * instruction set architectures
  * MLIR and intermediate representations
  * bytecode formats
* programming
  * Kubernetes
  * composing LLMs, AI in general
  * UNIX
  * Reactive programming
  * Ethereum
  * custom hardware
  * formalized programs
* self improvement
  * binary bootstrapping using Julia
  * git(hub) decentralized program distribution
  * extend library
