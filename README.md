Hi! I'm Coll and I'm a full-time researcher and software engineer. I'm building a categorical software stack.

After 10 years in the industry and much work on the side I decided to dedicate full-time on this project. I'm researching very abstract topics to develop the tools I needed, but that was hardly viable for my employers.

I produce lots of Creative Commons Zero that you might want to support!

## YAML Diagrams
I'm building a Diagram development environment with UNIX and YAML.

## QPL 2024
I presented a poster to the Quantum Physics and Logic 2024 conference. It is an academic presentation of YAML Diagrams and can be found here:

## Future work
Diagrams unify math and programming by binding the syntactic and semantic views. They are a powerful alternative to Abstract Syntax Trees and I would like to write full-stack diagrammatic programs all the way to the hardware instructions.
