Hello from Buenos Aires, Argentina! ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·

I'm MartÃ­n Coll, a computer scientist and engineer building a new generation of programming tools and computer systems.

I believe that in this era of hardware-software co-design, software development has the largest upside considering the lag behind computer science and math. It is also necessary to develop more theory, as we keep discovering useful models.

## Iâ€™m currently working on

### HIF: Hypergraph Interchange Format
HIF is a standard for representing higher-order network data, designed to enable seamless data exchange between higher-order network analysis
software packages.

I presented HIF at NetSci2025 in the Software and Data for Supporting Network Science satellite.

### MLIR Inet dialect
The MLIR Inet dialect is an addition to the core of the MLIR compiler formalizing Interaction Nets.

### Widip: Wiring Diagram Processing
Widip is a computing system that uses YAML as an intermediate representation of Hypergraphs. `nx_yaml` supports the round-trip of the standard YAML textual form through NetworkX as the implementation of the internal graph representation.

### Academic writing
I publish plain text sources for academic and related writings. These can be edited to produce new binary artifacts such as PDFs.
