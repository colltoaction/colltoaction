Hi! I'm Coll and I'm a full-time researcher and software engineer.

After 10 years in the industry and much work on the side I decided to dedicate full-time on my projects. I'm researching very abstract topics to develop the tools I wish I had all this time.

I'm receiving donations to ensure sustainability of this project for the years to come. I want to be an independent open contributor and your help will have a big impact in my economy.

## QPL 2024
I want to present my tooling in this logicians conference. Doing this is a really exciting and ambitious challenge that requires me to have a good formalism.
